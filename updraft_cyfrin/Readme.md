The first 2 files named `updraft_cyfrin/PatrickCollins/SimpleStorageSC` and `updraft_cyfrin/PatrickCollins/StorageFactorySC` have been created when I was trying to learn from Freecodecamp long video from youtube. From Aug 31 onwards, I have been learning on the updraft learning platform which has better structure and smaller videos.
